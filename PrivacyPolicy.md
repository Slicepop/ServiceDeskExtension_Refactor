# Privacy Policy for Service Desk Extension

**Effective Date:** [06/03/25]

Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine ("we", "our", or "us") has developed the **Service Desk Extension** ("extension") to enhance the user experience within our internal service request interface. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect data through the extension.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

The Service Desk Extension may collect and use the following limited data types:

- **Authentication Information**  
  We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to identify unique users for the purpose of displaying real-time presence within support tickets. No usernames, passwords, or personally identifiable information (PII) are collected or stored.

- **User Activity**  
  We track minimal real-time activity such as which support ticket a technician is currently viewing. This is used only to improve internal collaboration.

- **Website Content (Read-Only)**  
  The extension reads page elements within `https://support.wmed.edu` to enhance the interface with tooltips and controls. This content is processed locally and is not stored or transmitted externally.

---

## 2. How We Use Data

Data is used solely to enable the core functionality of the extension:
- Showing who is currently viewing a ticket (presence indicator)
- Applying interface enhancements such as tooltips or streamlined buttons
- Remembering UI preferences (e.g., dark mode)

---

## 3. Data Sharing and Transfer

We do **not**:
- Sell or transfer data to third parties
- Share data for advertising or profiling
- Use collected data for credit or lending purposes

Data remains internal and is used only for the extension's single stated purpose.

---

## 4. Data Retention

We do not store persistent user profiles. Anonymous session data may be temporarily retained in Firebase to enable real-time features but is not tied to any personally identifiable information.

---

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to ensure data is transmitted securely using Firebaseâ€™s secure infrastructure. No sensitive information is stored locally or in external databases by this extension.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Since this is an internal-use extension for WMed employees, standard organizational IT policies and protections apply. No personal data is collected that would require GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA compliance disclosures.
